            <p>An abaya is an outer garment worn by women in some parts of the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia and the Arabian Gulf region. It is long-sleeved, floor-length, and traditionally black. The abaya is worn over street clothes when a woman leaves her home and is designed to be loose and flowing, hiding the "curves" of the body. The abaya may slip over the head but usually opens in the front, closing with snaps, a zipper, or overlapping layers.</p>
            
            <p>The sleeves are formed from the same piece of fabric; they are not stitched on separately. The abaya may be worn with other pieces of Islamic clothing, such as a scarf which covers the hair (hijab or tarha), and perhaps a veil which covers the face ( niqab or shayla).</p>
